OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy of @ weeks of daily low-dose oral prednisolone in improving pain , mobility , and systemic low-grade inflammation in the short term and whether the effect would be sustained at @ weeks in older adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with primary knee OA were randomized @:@ ; @ received @ mg/day of prednisolone and @ received placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	Outcome measures included pain reduction and improvement in function scores and systemic inflammation markers .
METHODS	Pain was assessed using the visual analog pain scale ( @-@ mm ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores , patient global assessment ( PGA ) of the severity of knee OA , and @-min walk distance ( @MWD ) .
METHODS	Serum levels of interleukin @ ( IL-@ ) , IL-@ , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) were measured .
RESULTS	There was a clinically relevant reduction in the intervention group compared to the placebo group for knee pain , physical function , PGA , and @MWD at @ weeks .
RESULTS	The mean difference between treatment arms ( @ % CI ) was @ ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ; @ ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ; @ ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ ; and @ ( @-@ @ ) , p < @ , respectively .
RESULTS	Further , there was a clinically relevant reduction in the serum levels of IL-@ , IL-@ , TNF - , and hsCRP at @ weeks in the intervention group when compared to the placebo group .
RESULTS	These differences remained significant at @ weeks .
RESULTS	The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International responder rate was @ % in the intervention group and @ % in the placebo group ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Low-dose oral prednisolone had both a short-term and a longer sustained effect resulting in less knee pain , better physical function , and attenuation of systemic inflammation in older patients with knee OA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity .
BACKGROUND	Yet , empirical evidence for individual ( trait ) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake .
OBJECTIVE	It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .
METHODS	Participants ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions ( sad/neutral ) .
METHODS	Attentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli .
METHODS	Self-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( DEBQ ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer .
RESULTS	Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition .
RESULTS	Yet , attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition , but not in the sad mood condition .
CONCLUSIONS	The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating ( based on the DEBQ ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad , at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women .
CONCLUSIONS	Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state , and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general , but maybe not during sad mood .
